# [English] Optical Interferometry Part 1_ Introduction & ZYGO GPI layout

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,300
Hi everyone,
Today I want to talk about optical interferometry,  

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,700
a method that is frequently used to measure the 
properties of optical components and systems.  

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,060
What initially made me want to do a video about 
this subject is this ZYGO interferometer, that I  

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,580
bought a while ago second hand. A new instrument 
of this type is financially far out of my reach,  

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,740
and I must admit, this one wasn’t a bargain 
either. But the thing is, I’ve wanted to own  

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,620
a high-quality interferometer for a long time, 
if only to get away from the DIY-setups I’ve  

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,720
used so far. And since these instruments are 
not abundantly available second hand, I just  

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,440
had to take this rare opportunity to buy one.
In case you have no idea what this instrument is:  

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,500
with it you can very accurately measure the 
shape of flat and spherical optical interfaces,  

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,260
like the ones you find on lenses and mirrors. And 
with accurately I mean: in the nanometer range.  

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,780
But not only that, you can also measure the 
performance of complete optical systems. So,  

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,600
a good interferometer is an indispensable tool for 
anyone involved in optical fabrication. Because  

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
in the end, the quality of your optics is mainly 
limited by the quality of your testing methods. 
 

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,280
This particular instrument was produced 
by ZYGO in August of 1996. It was sold  

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,300
to Philips Electronics in Eindhoven, 
where it was used to check the surface  

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,980
shape of lenses for special optical 
disk drives. From what I understood,  

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,200
some of these lenses were produced from small 
polished glass balls. These were cut in pieces,  

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,400
and then transformed into very short 
focal distance lenses. Now, at some point,  

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,640
the activity was transferred to a Philips spin-off 
called Anteryon and the interferometer was sold to  

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,980
an employee, who basically stored it for a couple 
of years. He then sold it to me, together with a  

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,600
black and white monitor and the transmission 
sphere that was used to test the lenses.
 

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,940
In this video, I’ll first discuss 
the principle behind interferometry,  

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,380
and then we will look at the layout of the 
instrument and how it works exactly. And in  

24
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,000
an upcoming video I will show how I pimped the 
instrument a bit with a modern ccd camera. 
 

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,360
As I said earlier, in optics manufacture, 
interferometry is a frequently used method  

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,760
to characterize both optical surfaces as well 
as complete systems. The method is based on  

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,220
analyzing interference patterns and extract so 
called “wavefront” information from them and I  

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,920
will discuss the meaning of the word wavefront in 
a second. Interferometry is an extremely sensitive  

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,380
and accurate method that can be used to establish 
the general shape of an interface, but also things  

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,800
like waviness or even surface roughness. It 
does also have some limitations: The measurement  

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,640
range is generally fairly limited to several 
microns. Also, it’s unsuitable for interfaces that  

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,700
contain sharp step-like height features, because 
these cannot be unambiguously identified. So,  

33
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,520
in general, interferometry is most accurate when 
the surfaces we want to test are fairly smooth. 
 

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,700
Now, I just mentioned the word “wavefront”, 
which I think is not a trivial concept.  

35
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,980
I guess we have all experienced wavefronts at some 
point in our lives but I’m not referring to those.  

36
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,420
In optics a wavefront is actually a continuous set 
of points that have identical phase. So, what does  

37
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,120
that mean? Well, from a classical viewpoint, light 
is an electromagnetic field that harmonically  

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,180
oscillates and propagates in space. And at any 
given point in this process, the electric and  

39
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,620
magnetic field components can be described by 
the Maxwell equations. So here I’ve tried to  

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,800
schematically draw the electromagnetic field in 
a somewhat larger volume and if you examine the  

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,840
phase of these waves, you can identify planes 
where the phase of the electromagnetic field  

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,380
is identical. And a continuous set of points that 
have the same phase value is called a wavefront. 
 

43
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,300
One property of a wavefront is that its shape 
is always transverse or perpendicular to the  

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,980
local direction of wave propagation. Here 
this is illustrated for a few differently  

45
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,800
shaped wavefronts where the arrows indicate the 
direction of wave propagation. Now in general,  

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,140
phase relationships for different points in 
space are only well-defined when the waves  

47
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,840
have one specific wavelength. And if we want to 
do interferometry, it is vital that the light we  

48
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,360
use is of one particular wavelength, which 
is also called monochromatic light. And in  

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,100
the rest of the video, I’ll assume that the 
light used is more or less monochromatic.
 

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,940
A frequently used way to generate monochromatic 
radiation is by means of a laser. This is because,  

51
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,820
the process of stimulated emission which takes 
place in the laser cavity, favors the generation  

52
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,840
of light in a very narrow wavelength range. 
Also, the wavefront exiting the laser cavity is  

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,000
virtually flat over the aperture. And because the 
light has an extremely well-defined wavelength,  

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,640
in other words it has a very narrow spectral 
bandwidth, phase relationships in the field  

55
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,540
exiting the laser can be preserved over long 
distances. Another way to say this is that lasers  

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,900
have a large coherence length, which is generally 
between half a meter up to several kilometers for  

57
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,560
certain special types of lasers. In practice 
this means that, if we take 2 points A and B in  

58
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,900
the light path and we look at the variations in 
the phase difference between these 2 points, we  

59
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,020
will find that these will be relatively small. And 
the distance over which variations in phase remain  

60
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,140
acceptable is called the coherence length. As you 
can see from this equation, the coherence length  

61
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,080
(Lc) is inversely proportional to the spectral 
band width (delta nu) of the light source. And  

62
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,480
so light sources with a very narrow emission line 
will generally have a long coherence length. 
 

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,720
Another source of monochromatic light frequently 
used in interferometry is the low-pressure sodium  

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,680
lamp, which mainly generates light in a 
narrow emission band at 589nm. However,  

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,780
the spectral bandwidth of the Sodium emission 
line is much broader than that of lasers and  

66
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,640
the phase relationships generally only 
hold over distances smaller than a mm.
 

67
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,460
Now, measuring the shape of a wavefront 
directly in the visible part of the  

68
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,100
electromagnetic spectrum is not easy and that is 
because of the very high frequencies involved.  

69
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,080
For electromagnetic radiation of longer 
wavelengths, like for example radio waves,  

70
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,420
we can measure the phase of the alternating fields 
directly. And that is because the oscillations  

71
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,580
have a relatively low frequency, say generally 
somewhere in the mega- or giga- Hertz range.  

72
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,400
And so, we can point a bunch of antennas to the 
sky, measure the Electromagnetic signals that  

73
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,380
are received in each of them and establish the 
shape of the wavefront for a particular frequency  

74
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,440
by looking for phase correlations. And based on 
this information we can then identify the exact  

75
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,680
direction from which the radiation is emitted. But 
visible light has a frequency more than a thousand  

76
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,440
times higher than even the highest frequency 
radio waves. And for frequencies this high, it is  

77
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,420
technically infeasible to measure phase directly 
for an oscillating electromagnetic field.
 

78
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,380
However, what we can easily measure with 
optical detectors, like CCD- or CMOS-sensors,  

79
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,720
is spatial intensity variations. And 
that is where interferometry comes in:  

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,780
instead of trying to measure the phase in light 
directly, this method works by studying the  

81
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,720
interference patterns resulting from the addition 
of a second wavefront that has a known shape.
 

82
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,060
Let me start by showing you a very simple 
example of how this works in light.  

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,420
For this experiment we need a monochromatic 
light source and a flat surface. As a light  

84
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,100
source we’ll use a sodium lamp and for the 
surface we will use a flat optical test glass.  

85
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,620
Now, a typical air-glass interface 
reflects about 4% of the incident light  

86
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,060
and with a uniform light source, 
we observe a uniform reflection.  

87
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,900
Let’s now place 2 differently shaped surfaces on 
top of this reference surface for evaluation. What  

88
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,540
we observe is that these objects show 2 different 
interference patterns. The part to the left,  

89
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,180
shows straight lines with equal spacing. And the 
one to the right, displays these curved lines or  

90
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,880
circular fringes, depending on the exact surface 
orientation. Now, it’s these intensity variations  

91
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,520
that actually contain detailed information about 
the difference in shape between reference surface  

92
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,980
and the two surfaces under test. We just need 
to know how to interpret what we see exactly. 
 

93
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,360
So, what do we see? Well let me explain with 
an animation. I admit, the following is a  

94
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,100
simplification and it’s not correctly visualizing 
the physics, but it’s actually quite illustrative.  

95
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,820
Here is a wavefront that has just reflected off 
a flat reference surface, so this wavefront is  

96
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,420
basically also flat. And so the image shows a 
2D cross section of the flat optical wavefronts.  

97
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,300
If we place a sensor in the path of the 
light, we can measure the intensity,  

98
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,160
and what we observe is that it is basically the 
same everywhere and this tells us exactly nothing  

99
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,980
about the shape of the wavefront. Now, let’s add 
a second wavefront that has reflected of a second  

100
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,040
surface that is slightly tilted. In this example 
the wavefront is also flat and what we observe  

101
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,740
is that the intensity now becomes non-uniformly. 
And this is caused by constructive and destructive  

102
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,160
interference between the 2 reflected wavefronts 
at the second interface. Here, the electromagnetic  

103
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,800
field is the linear sum of the contributions 
of the fields of the 2 wavefronts. And so,  

104
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,020
in some points where these contributions are 
always in phase, they add up. On the other hand,  

105
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,420
in places where the two are exactly in out 
of phase, the field contributions cancel each  

106
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,720
other out and if they are of equal amplitude, 
effectively the resulting field becomes zero. 
 

107
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:18,420
In the case of 2 flat wavefronts, we will observe 
linear and equally spaced fringes. The density of  

108
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,280
the interference pattern itself is dependent 
on the wedge or angle between the surfaces.  

109
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,620
And the position of the fringes is dependent 
on the distance between the two surfaces. Now,  

110
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,800
you might think that linear and equally spaced 
fringes are indicative for the presence of 2 flat  

111
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,760
surfaces. And that is partly correct, but 2 curved 
wavefronts with the same radius of curvature will  

112
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,760
actually also display linear and equally spaced 
fringes, when displaced or tilted. However,  

113
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,920
when two wavefronts have different radii, this 
results in curved fringes. This is for example  

114
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,800
the case when we have a flat- and a spherical 
wavefront interfering. Or when we have 2 spherical  

115
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,960
wavefronts that have a different radius curvature. 
So, I guess it is important to realize that  

116
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,080
the observed interference pattern only gives us 
information about differences in wavefront shape.
 

117
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,500
In the example just shown with the sodium lamp 
light, we only observe interference between  

118
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,180
interfaces when they are placed very close 
together. And that is because of the limited  

119
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,060
coherence length of the light. So whether we see a 
clear interference pattern is dependent on whether  

120
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,300
stable phase relationships exist between the 
reflections coming off the two surfaces at the  

121
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,640
point where they start interfering. This means 
that with a coherence length smaller than a mm,  

122
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,740
the surfaces need to be quite close to each 
other in order to observe interference fringes. 
 

123
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,040
Now I just stated that in constructive 
interference, the electromagnetic fields  

124
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,620
add up and in destructive interference, the 
2 contributions cancel each other out. So,  

125
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,320
what does this mean for intensity? Well, 
light intensity is equivalent to the power  

126
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,880
per unit of surface and so it is actually 
not the same thing as the magnitude of  

127
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,100
the electromagnetic field. In fact, intensity 
scales with the square of this field. And so,  

128
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,940
if we have 2 reflections of equal magnitude, say 
both are 4%, this means that for the location of  

129
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,000
constructive interference, intensity could be 
4 times as high. And that is actually what is  

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,920
generally observed in interference patterns: 
that the intensity in the bright areas is  

131
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,960
much brighter than the sum of the 2 individual 
intensities. But of course, if we look on average,  

132
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,260
the intensity over the whole area will still 
equal to the sum of the 2 individual intensities.
 

133
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,740
Anyway, enough background. Let’s return to the 
ZYGO interferometer itself and take a peek under  

134
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,920
the hood to see what’s going on inside. In order 
to do that we need to remove 2 different lids:  

135
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,480
the outer one is made of plastic and is 
basically just cosmetic. The second one is  

136
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,580
made out of aluminum sheet metal and is intended 
as RF-shielding for the electronics inside. 
 

137
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,720
First thing you notice is, that it isn’t awfully 
full inside. There is a helium Neon laser with  

138
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,180
its high-voltage power supply. Then there are a 
few optical components like a steering mirror for  

139
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,980
the laser beam, a variable filter that can be 
moved mechanically using a long rod. This rod  

140
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,700
also operates a switch, that activates either of 
2 pcb-cameras that are also found in the top part  

141
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:34,380
of the interferometer. The cameras by the way 
have CCD-chips of about 6x4mm in size and are  

142
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,160
fairly low resolution. Both cameras have lenses 
mounted in front of them. One of the camera is  

143
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,200
above a tiny beam splitter, and the other one is 
above a diffusor with a crosshair printed on it.  

144
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,680
In the bottom compartment, behind the lid 
here, we find a mains 12V DC power supply,  

145
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,980
a large beam splitter, a mirror under 45 
degrees and 4-inch collimation lens. And  

146
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,780
apart from a few brackets and mounts that hold 
the optics together, that is basically it. 
 

147
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,220
So you might wonder: why was this thing the 
price of a luxury car back in 1996? Well,  

148
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,100
apart from I suspect a healthy profit margin, 
there are several reasons: of course, it’s not  

149
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,080
really a mass manufactured item. But another 
reason is that every component inside appears  

150
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,480
to be of very high quality. Take for example 
the Helium Neon laser: according to the label,  

151
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,720
the tube has been specifically selected for this 
type of instrument. Why? Well, if we look at the  

152
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,460
specification of the coherence length of the 
interferometer, we see that it is larger than  

153
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,520
100m. This means that the wavelength variations 
in the laser light need to be extremely low,  

154
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,520
so that phase relationships hold over distances of 
more than 100m. Now, I calculated what this means  

155
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,440
in terms of frequency stability and found that 
variations in the frequency of the 632nm light  

156
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,820
cannot be more than 2. 10-7 percent. And so, this 
means that not just any random laser will do.
 

157
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,960
So let me take you through the functionality of 
all the components step by step using schematics.  

158
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,700
Here is the Helium-Neon laser, which 
outputs a highly coherent beam of  

159
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,380
light. The direction of the beam can be 
optimized with a small steering mirror,  

160
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,720
after which the beam goes through the variable 
attenuation filter. This filter allows adjustment  

161
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,120
of the general brightness of the laser beam. 
After having passed the attenuation filter, the  

162
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,800
beam is going into a gradient index lens, which 
is connected to a very small beam splitter. 
 

163
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,600
Now, a gradient index lens is a small glass rod 
that contains a gradient in refractive index,  

164
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,240
that runs from the center to edge of the rod. 
Since the refractive index has the highest value  

165
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
in the center, the optical wave front in the 
laser beam is gradually delayed more towards  

166
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,640
the center of the rod. The wavefront therefore 
becomes curved, which effectively results in  

167
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,580
focusing of the light into a tight focal point. 
And after passing this focal point, the beam  

168
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,600
expands again into a nicely spherical wavefront. A 
small beam splitter sends the spherical wavefront  

169
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,760
to the partially reflective surface of a 
second, much larger beam splitter. This  

170
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,780
surface reflects the light towards a collimation 
lens, where the light exits the instrument. 
 

171
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,380
The function of the collimation lens is to 
convert the spherical wavefront into a flat  

172
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,720
wavefront of 4 inches in diameter. And this 
flat wavefront can serve as the basis for all  

173
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,480
kinds of interferometric tests. For example, we 
can place 2 partially reflective flat interfaces  

174
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,880
into this output beam, one being a reference 
interface and one being the interface that  

175
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,780
we like to test for flatness. And due to 
the large coherence length of the light,  

176
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,940
more than 100m, these interfaces don’t have 
the be necessarily very close together.  

177
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,340
The light reflecting off these surfaces 
is directed back into the interferometer  

178
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,960
approximately along the same path as it came 
from, goes through the small beam splitter  

179
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,839
again and is then collimated and projected on 
a CCD chip. And this allows us to observe the  

180
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,359
interference pattern between the 2 reflections 
and evaluate this visually on the monitor. 
 

181
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,839
Now, to steer the light of both the reference 
and test surface exactly back through the tiny  

182
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,799
beam splitter here, is pretty hard. And 
you don’t see anything with camera 1,  

183
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,860
until things are almost perfectly aligned. So, to 
make life a lot easier, the people at ZYGO added  

184
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,620
this alignment functionality to the system. Part 
of the light from the reflections can pass this  

185
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,800
larger beam splitter. This part continues straight 
on, is reflected at a 90 degrees angle and then  

186
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,920
reaches a glass diffuser plate that contains a 
cross-hair pattern. Because this diffusor plate is  

187
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,440
exactly at the focal distance of the collimation 
lens, the reflections create tiny spots here. And  

188
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,440
their positions can be observed by camera 2 that 
is only intended for alignment purposes. Now,  

189
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,780
this alignment unit has a much larger field of 
view and what we can do now is simply align the  

190
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,240
position of surface reflections such that they 
are at the center of the cross-hair. And when  

191
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,520
that is the case, the system is automatically also 
aligned on camera 1 and we can immediately observe  

192
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,340
an interferogram. Now, the interferometers 
that I made myself did not have this kind of  

193
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,320
feature and it must admit that this makes 
aligning optics really a piece of cake.
 

194
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,900
Here you see the location of the collimation 
lens, viewed from the outside of the instrument.  

195
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,300
In front of it is an adjustment mechanism 
that is intended for mounting various  

196
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,880
reference surfaces to the interferometer 
directly, like the F/0.75 transmission  

197
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,820
sphere that came with the interferometer. The 
adjustment mechanism has 2 degrees of freedom,  

198
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,340
which are tip and tilt. This allows the angle of 
the transmission reference to be oriented with  

199
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,380
respect to the surface under test.
When testing optical components,  

200
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,780
you generally test the surface shape before 
the interfaces get coated. And so in the case  

201
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,300
of glass this means that they reflect around 4% of 
the incident light. So, the transmission reference  

202
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,000
also needs to reflect around 4% back into the 
interferometer to get high-contrast fringes.
 

203
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,780
To test spherical surfaces, you need a spherical 
reference surface that somehow reflects 4% of the  

204
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,713
light exiting the interferometer right back into 
the instrument. Now the way this is achieved is as  

205
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:37,500
follows: here I’ve drawn a schematic of the inside 
of a transmission sphere assembly to show you how  

206
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,440
that is achieved. The reference surface is the 
last interface of the assembly, here indicated in  

207
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,460
yellow. All the other surfaces are anti-reflection 
coated for the laser wavelength, but even more  

208
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,780
importantly, they are also designed in such a way, 
that the light reaches the reference interface  

209
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,260
exactly perpendicular. And this means that it is 
the only interface in the transmission sphere that  

210
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,240
sends a reflection back where it came from and 
then enters the interferometer as a collimated  

211
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,260
beam. Of course, 96% of the light continues on 
to the surface under test, which also reflects  

212
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,780
around 4%. And so we observe the interference 
occurring between these 2 interfaces. 
 

213
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,340
With a spherical transmission reference, we 
can test convex- as well as concave optics.  

214
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,280
For convex optics, only radii smaller than the 
radius of the transmission sphere itself can be  

215
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,560
tested. For concave optics, the only limitation 
for the radius to be tested is that it should be  

216
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,320
less than half of the maximum coherence length 
of the light source which is in this case 50m. 
 

217
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,120
Now I want to save most of the experiments 
that I had in mind for another video,  

218
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,400
but let’s just do one simple experiment. For 
this test, we’ll just use the flat wavefront  

219
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,560
exiting the instrument. And what we will try to 
measure is the difference in shape between the  

220
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,740
2 surfaces of a Zerodur test glass. This test 
glass has one side which I know is very flat,  

221
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,080
around 1/20th of a wavelength. And this is 
going to be our reference interface. But the  

222
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,160
other side is somewhat less flat. And what 
we’ll try to find out is how much that is. 
 

223
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,500
The two interfaces are spaced 20 mm apart and 
both reflect about 4% of the incident light. So  

224
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,000
we can just place the disk in the beam exiting 
the interferometer, align the position of the  

225
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,860
2 reflections simultaneously and then look at 
the interference pattern. And this is what it  

226
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,020
looks like. As you can see, we get a nice and 
clear interference pattern, which by the way is  

227
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,720
extremely stable with no effects of vibrations 
from the environment. That is because the two  

228
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,100
surfaces are basically mechanically connected 
to each other by a solid piece of Zerodur.  

229
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,160
Now, the small circular spots are just dust 
particles in the optical path and these are  

230
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,200
not important for our evaluation. All the 
information about the difference in shape  

231
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,420
and orientation between the 2 surfaces is 
contained in the 4 more or less vertical  

232
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,200
fringes. And because we know that 
one side is almost perfectly flat,  

233
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,720
any curvature in the fringe pattern is the 
result of non-flatness of the second surface. 
 

234
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,140
So, let’s try to evaluate this pattern visually. 
The most obvious feature is of course the presence  

235
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,440
of the 4 vertical fringes, that indicate that 
there is a wedge between the 2 interfaces in  

236
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,120
horizontal direction. And we can calculate how 
large this wedge is, based on the number of  

237
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,820
fringes. It is a little over 4 Lambda wavefront, 
meaning that there is a wedge half of that between  

238
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,580
the 2 surfaces, so just 2 wavelengths. Why 
half? Well, that is because in reflection,  

239
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,880
any deviations in surface shape, lead to twice 
the deviation in the wavefront shape. And so,  

240
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,380
deviations in surface shape are only 
half of that observed in the wavefront.  

241
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:00,900
Now, since the wavelength of the laser is 632.8nm 
and the wedge is 2 lambda between the 2 surface  

242
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,920
this, would mean a gradient in distance of 
approx. 1.3 microns. But there is a little  

243
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,100
catch in this case. Because we are comparing 2 
surfaces with Zerodur between them, we should  

244
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,020
actually use the wavelength in this material. 
Which means that we should divide the wavelength  

245
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:27,240
in air or vacuum by the refractive index of 
Zerodur, which is 1.54. So this means that the  

246
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:35,520
wedge is actually only 840nm. But which side is 
thicker? It’s hard to tell because as for wedge,  

247
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,100
we would see the same type of interference pattern 
in either case. So at this point, we don’t know.
 

248
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,880
Okay, let’s for a moment focus on the curvature 
of the fringes now, which indicates a difference  

249
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,980
in the radius between the 2 surfaces. If 
we look at how much the curvature in the  

250
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,360
fringes deviates from a straight line, we see 
that it is largest here in the center, and it  

251
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,860
is about 0.4 times the fringe spacing, which 
translates to 0.4 wavelength of height difference  

252
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,340
between edge and center of the disk. For the 
surface error, which again is half of that,  

253
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,580
we find 0.2 wavelengths, Now, since we also 
need to use the wavelength inside Zerodur here,  

254
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,420
this means that the surface curvature is 0.2*times 
the wavelength divided by the refractive index,  

255
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:30,180
which results in a value of 82nm. But 
in which direction is the curve? Is the  

256
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:36,840
surface under test 82nm concave or convex? As 
with the direction of the wedge, there is no  

257
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,240
easy way to tell. So now we end up with these 4 
configurations of which only one can be correct. 
 

258
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,660
With a little logic though, you could at this 
point already discard 2 of these as infeasible.  

259
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:55,080
But of course, you want to know exactly which 
configuration of the 4 is correct, right?  

260
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,380
So, if that is indeed the case, figure it out 
yourself. You just need a 2 more pieces of  

261
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,780
information. Here is the first hint: if I press 
my finger against the backside of the disk,  

262
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,580
so on the surface under test, we can observe 
that the interferogram changes due to temperature  

263
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,340
increase of the material by the heat of my finger. 
Locally, it is only a few degrees Celsius higher,  

264
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,660
but the effect is very noticeable because 
we are measuring in the nanometer range.  

265
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,660
Now, the second piece of information you need 
is about the expansion coefficient of the  

266
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,780
material. As you can see from the specifications 
of Zerodur, it can be either positive or negative.  

267
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,640
But this piece of Zerodur has a positive 
coefficient of thermal expansion, which  

268
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,740
means it expands with temperature increase. And 
with these 2 additional pieces of information,  

269
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,200
it is possible tell which of these 4 options 
is correct. Now, the first person to make  

270
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,820
a comment with the correct answer and 
course why, owns the pinned comment.
 

271
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay, so the latter was a very brief explanation 
of how you can evaluate interferograms visually.  

272
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,300
And, the above example was actually relatively 
easy. Imagine your interferogram looks something  

273
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,880
like this. Or this. In these cases, it would be 
quite a bit more challenging to make accurate  

274
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,340
statements about the exact surface shape. This 
is why in the next video about this subject,  

275
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:23,580
I have replaced the current analog camera with a 
high-resolution IP-camera. This allows for very  

276
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,980
detailed evaluation of interferograms using 
software. And with the help of this software,  

277
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,320
we can measure wedges, angles, surface 
curvature, and even the effects of warm  

278
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,720
fingers very accurately. Also, we will take a look 
at how to measure the shape of various optical  

279
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,360
surfaces, and the quality of lens assemblies. So, 
hopefully I’ll see you in the next video again.

# [English] Optical Interferometry Part 2_ Measuring Optics with a Zygo GPI LC

1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,430
Hey everyone,
Today, I want to demonstrate how the ZYGO

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,050
interferometer that I bought a few months
ago can be used to test optics. In the previous

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,320
video, I explained how interferometry works,
what a wavefront is, and discussed the layout

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,970
of the instrument. If you are unfamiliar with
interferometry and you haven't seen the previous

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,980
video, it might be a good idea to watch that
one first.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,539
This video became quite long, so here is an
overview of the contents, which allows you

7
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,210
to skip ahead if you don’t want to watch
everything. First, I'll show how I replaced

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,820
the original low-resolution camera of the
ZYGO with a modern IP camera to record high-resolution

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,170
interferograms. And then, we'll take a quick
look at how we can use the camera in combination

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,010
with a software called DFT-fringe to create
detailed wavefront maps.

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,570
The interferometer came with a reference transmission
sphere, but unfortunately the wavefront documentation

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,480
of this item was missing. So, to do meaningful
measurements with it, we first need to establish

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,970
its accuracy by performing a calibration.
And with that done, we can test some actual

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,580
optics: we'll examine the surface properties
of a high-quality concave wafer scanner mirror

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,280
from the 1970s. Then we will take a look at
the wavefront quality of a vintage Canon F/1.2

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,570
lens from the early 1980s. We’ll do the
same for a modern full-frame Canon EF zoom

17
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,000
lens. And in the last part of the video, I’ll
show you measurements on the optical properties

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,040
of a couple of microscope objectives. All
in all, there is a lot to cover so let’s

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,810
dive right in.
As shown in the previous video, the interferometer

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,479
is a somewhat basic version, that displayed
low-resolution black and white images on a

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,509
monitor for visual evaluation. The instrument
contained two cameras: one for alignment of

22
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,750
the optics under test and one for displaying
the interferogram. Both cameras had a rather

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,509
limited resolution of 320x240 pixels. Now,
since this is not 1996 anymore, we can now

24
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,979
do quite a bit better than that.
For the new camera to record the interferograms,

25
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,500
I wanted to use a housed camera with some
kind of mount to be able to attach various

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,019
types lenses. And if you look at the layout
of the instrument, there is actually plenty

27
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,940
of space to place such a camera in the instrument
right here. We just need to redirect the light

28
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,050
in the horizontal direction. So what I did
was remove the old camera and the lens, and

29
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,670
then made a bracket that can hold a first
surface mirror under 45-degrees. And this

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,450
mirror redirects the vertical beam to a horizontal
one, which can then be captured by the camera.

31
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,680
I tried different kinds of lenses and eventually
settled on this compact 25mm c-mount lens

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,970
that works for most situations. It is able
to capture the full field of the interferometer,

33
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,730
while at the same time covering a fairly large
area of the camera chip. But of course, for

34
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,480
specific measurements, it is possible to use
other lenses, like lenses with a longer focal

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,700
length or a variable zoom lens. And this can
be very useful if you want to to look at small

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,349
details in interferograms. By the way, I left
the original alignment camera where it was,

37
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,610
because it still works fine and you actually
don’t need a lot of resolution to do the

38
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,330
alignment. So the original monitor is still
used in the setup, but only during alignment

39
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,670
procedures.
For powering the IP camera, I connected it

40
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,340
to the 12V power supply already present in
the instrument. And after that, there was

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,250
just one more thing left to do and that was
bringing the camera's UTP connection to the

42
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,951
housing of the instrument. For this purpose,
I used a two-sided UTP female connector. One

43
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:43,110
side connects to the camera, and the other
side connects to the PC. And with that, the

44
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,420
conversion is complete.
Now, I used an IDS ethernet camera for the

45
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,170
conversion, but in fact any camera will do
as long as it can be accessed from a computer,

46
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,220
and the images can be stored to disk. So,
to capture the data what I do is align the

47
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,580
optic to be measured such that a clear interferogram
is visible with well-defined fringes. It helps

48
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,810
if the camera software has a feature to monitor
the maximum fringe intensity so that we can

49
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,470
adjust it to within the linear dynamic range
of the camera. Then I collect a number of

50
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,190
interferograms with somewhat different fringe
angles and spacings. And these can then serve

51
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,530
as a basis for a wavefront analysis.
For the actual wavefront calculations, we'll

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,150
used a free software called DFTfringe. It’s
programmed by Dale Eason, who took it upon

53
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,810
himself to make advanced interferometry accessible
to the masses. It is designed with amateur

54
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,440
telescope making in mind, but as will become
clear, its application range is quite a bit

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,600
broader than that. I won't delve into all
the functionality of the software. Instead,

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,830
I'll just very quickly walk you through the
process of evaluating interferograms and averaging

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,040
wavefront data.
So here is the start screen of DFT fringe.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
Before it can evaluate the interferograms
correctly, the program requires the input

59
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,199
of a few settings, like what wavelength is
used, and what the fringe spacing in the interferogram

60
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,139
actually represents. In some configurations,
each fringe represents 1 wavelength of phase

61
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,360
shift. But in others, like in autocollimation,
this value actually needs to be set to 0.5.

62
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,479
And when all the parameters are set, we are
basically ready to go.

63
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,330
The software gets us to our results in a few
steps. You start by importing a recorded interferogram

64
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,940
and define the areas you wish to include or
exclude in the wavefront evaluation. If that

65
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,930
is done, the software performs a 2D Fourier
transform on the selected area and allows

66
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,400
us to do a bit of low-frequency spatial filtering.
This filtering can for example remove low

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,370
spatial frequencies that are result of the
global intensity variations due to uneven

68
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,870
illumination over the full surface. And after
setting the low-frequency spatial filter,

69
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,120
the image is resampled to a specific size
and from this, the software calculates the

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,730
wavefront data.
When the software calculates the wavefront,

71
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,790
it also fits the data to a specific set of
known aberrations. And this feature allows

72
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,060
for removing specific aberrations from your
analysis. For instance, tilt is generally

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,039
not an aberration of interest because it describes
the orientation between the reference and

74
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,340
the wavefront under test. And so it has nothing
to do with the shape of either surface. Now,

75
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,360
DFT-fringe allows you to either include or
exclude it from your analysis. You can customize

76
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,319
the presentation of the results and the scale.
For example you can convert wavefront errors

77
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,710
to surface shape errors and choose to present
them in nanometers instead of waves. All in

78
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,530
all, this is a very useful tool for interferometric
fringe analysis and on top of that it can

79
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:01,199
be downloaded for free.
In all upcoming experiments I will use this

80
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,191
F/0.75 transmission sphere as a reference.
And as I mentioned in the introduction, we

81
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:10,970
don’t know anything about its accuracy of
shape. So, before we can measure any meaningful

82
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,180
results with it, we need to measure the accuracy
of the reference sphere first. But how do

83
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,120
we do that? We could of course calibrate the
surface of the transmission sphere by comparing

84
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,000
its shape to a more precise reference surface.
But instead, I want to show you another method,

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,020
known as the “random ball” method.
The method requires the use of a small smooth

86
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,530
ball with a reflective surface. The surface
of the ball doesn't need to be perfectly spherical,

87
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,620
but I guess it helps if it is quite close-to-spherical.
Now the only thing we need to do for the experiment

88
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,060
is to measure the surface shape of the ball
at many random positions with the reference

89
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,210
sphere and then average these measurements.
The reason that this works is that, if you

90
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,159
collect a lot of samples from a ball surface
even if it’s far from perfect, all the errors

91
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,210
in individual parts of the surface will eventually
average out, and the average will iterate

92
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,220
to the surface equivalent of a perfect sphere.
And when you get to that point, the only error

93
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,539
that remains is the surface error in the reference
sphere because it is systematically present

94
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:21,670
in all the individual measurements.
You can buy these special high-accuracy SiC

95
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,400
balls for this purpose and these are pretty
expensive. However, there is a much cheaper

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,190
way: I just used a precision aluminum oxide
bearing ball that typically costs less than

97
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:37,630
25 euros online. The largest balls generally
have a diameter of around 10mm and have a

98
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,460
variation in the diameter of about 1 micron.
So they're not incredibly precise, but as

99
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,640
you will see, precise enough for this experiment.
To hold the ball, I made a stand from 3 quarter-inch

100
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,420
bearing balls, glued on top of an aluminum
rod using epoxy. And now we have a calibration

101
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,300
setup ready for less than 30 Euros.
The calibration procedure itself involves

102
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,120
placing this ball at the center of the radius
of curvature of the transmission sphere in

103
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,870
some random orientation. We record an interferogram,
then choose a different (random) area on the

104
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,320
ball, record another one and so on.
Here is what evaluating the results looks

105
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,390
like in practice: what you observe is that
in the individual measurements, the surface

106
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,740
error is generally larger than ¼ of a lambda
and is all over the place. And this is due

107
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,690
to the errors present in the shape of the
ball. But look what happens when we start

108
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,860
averaging these measurements: After 10 measurements,
the error has basically dropped down to 1/10th

109
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,500
of a lambda P-V. And by adding more and more
measurement to the average, we can gradually

110
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,750
bring this down even further. Until after
evaluating about 50 interferograms, we do

111
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,500
not see improvement any more in the result.
And at that point we know that the error that

112
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,130
remains is basically the error in the transmission
sphere reference.

113
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,640
If we look at the accuracy of shape in the
spherical reference, it is about 1/20 of a

114
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,630
wavelength peak to valley. And we will consider
this to be the wavefront accuracy over the

115
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,870
full area of the transmission sphere. Now
in all the upcoming tests, we will only use

116
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,470
a small fraction of this reference surface,
which will make the accuracy of the tests

117
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:26,890
quite a bit higher than the 1/20th of a lambda.
DFTfringe presents the value of the Strehl

118
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:33,630
ratio quite prominently. And I actually discussed
Strehl ratio in another video. Now I must

119
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,860
admit, Strehl ratio is not the most common
parameter used in the specification of the

120
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,820
optical quality of lenses. But for specifying
wavefront performance close to the diffraction

121
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,750
limit, I think it is a very useful parameter.
What it describes is basically just the ratio

122
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,839
between where wave energy actually ends up
in an image, compared to where it should have

123
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,389
ended up if the optic were perfect. So here
is a graph of an intensity profile of an imperfect

124
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,930
optic and of a perfect optic. To calculate
the Strehl we take the area that is under

125
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,220
both curves and name this B, and then divide
this by the area under the perfect curve,

126
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,399
so area A. This represents the fraction of
the light energy that goes to where it should

127
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,670
have gone in an image.
Since Strehl ratio is a fraction, its value

128
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,709
is between 0 and 1. And a value of 1 only
applies to an optic that performs at the theoretical

129
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:37,339
limit. Now, roughly speaking, an optic with
a Strehl ratio value above 0.83 is considered

130
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,579
to be “diffraction limited” What this
doesn’t mean is that the optic is performing

131
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:47,940
perfectly in this region. It just means that
the dominant factor for reduced sharpness

132
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,000
is because of diffraction, for example because
of a limited aperture. And to a lesser degree

133
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,090
it is due to the imperfections in things like
surface shape. So, in a sense the value of

134
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:04,070
0.83 is similar to stating that ¼ lambda
Peak to valley wavefront error is “diffraction

135
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,720
limited”. Because both these values are
kind of arbitrary definitions of what is meant

136
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,310
by “diffraction limited”.
So our reference surface turns out to be very

137
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,470
accurate, as we can conclude from both the
Strehl value as well as from the PV wavefront

138
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,690
error. But of course, that is kind of essential
if you want to use it to measure optical quality

139
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:31,560
of other objects in the high-end of the range.
The first thing we are going to measure is

140
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,260
the surface shape of this spherical Zerodur
mirror. It’s about 250mm in diameter and

141
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,890
has a radius of curvature of 350mm. I bought
the mirror about 10 years ago on eBay for

142
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,880
around 100 Euros. The reflective coating was
in pretty bad shape, so I removed it. But

143
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,670
the remaining surface reflectivity is 4%,
which is ideal in this test setup. The mirror

144
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,320
itself is from a 1970s Perkin-Elmer wafer
scanner system. This was the first commercial

145
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,320
photolithographic system that used non-contact
exposure of silicon wafers. So given its original

146
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,440
application, you’d expect this mirror to
be quite accurate.

147
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,050
The way we measure this mirror is with the
focus of the reference element in the center

148
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,440
of the radius of curvature of the mirror.
So, the tightly focused light beam from the

149
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,110
interferometer expands and reflects off the
mirror surface. It then returns along approximately

150
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,400
the same path and is recombined with the spherical
reference wavefront that reflects of the reference

151
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,620
element. And any deviations from spherical
in the mirror surface will cause phase shifts

152
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,050
between the light reflecting off the mirror
surface and the spherical reference. And this

153
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,470
can then be observed as interference.
Here are a few typical interferograms that

154
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,890
were measured with this mirror under a slight
tilt. Even though the mirror is strongly curved,

155
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,310
you can observe that in the measurements,
it only covers about half the diameter of

156
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,870
the total measurement area available. And
this makes our accuracy of measurement much

157
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,769
higher than 1/20th of a wavelength.
So from the interferograms just collected,

158
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,579
the wavefront differences between the mirror
surface and that of the reference element

159
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,500
is calculated in DFTfringe. you can see that
the peak to valley accuracy of this mirror

160
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,680
itself is around 1/10th of a wavelength. In
terms of surface shape accuracy, this means

161
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,860
that the mirror never deviates more than around
30nm of that of a perfect sphere. Anyway,

162
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,430
being able to measure with this level of precision
is actually pretty cool and it gave me confidence

163
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,470
that the instrument performs as expected.
By the way, if you have ever tried to make

164
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,610
a telescope mirror by hand yourself, you might
observe something familiar in the wavefron

165
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:53,759
plot: the mirror has a slightly turned down
edge, although very small, around 15nm or

166
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,510
so.
Next on the list of items to test is this

167
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:03,750
Canon FD 55mm F/1.2 lens. This is a rather
famous vintage lens in the sense that it was

168
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,060
actually the first consumer lens containing
an aspherical element. With its F/1.2 aperture,

169
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,070
it’s very light sensitive and therefore
well suited for indoor photography without

170
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,019
using a flash. The earliest versions of this
lens introduced in 1971, contained radioactive

171
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:27,350
Thorium Oxide, but this one, which was bought
by my father in march 1980, does not contain

172
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,269
Thorium. Therefore, it also does not display
the characteristic radiation browning observed

173
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,639
in radioactive lenses. On top of that it has
lived in a box most of its life so it’s

174
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,680
in nearly pristine condition.
For testing the wavefront deformation in this

175
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,691
lens, we utilize a configuration called autocollimation,
which is schematically depicted here. Because

176
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:52,769
the light passes through the lens twice in
this test, many aberrations are measured to

177
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,810
be twice as large as they would be with a
single pass. So when this configuration is

178
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,709
used, it requires us to interpret the fringe
spacing as equivalent with only 0.5 wavelength

179
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,399
instead of 1 wavelength.
Before I show you the result of the measurement,

180
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,009
I should mention that doing a wavefront measurement
on a lens is not in any way representative

181
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:20,690
for overall lens performance. Basically, we
are testing with only one particular wavelength

182
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,819
of light on the optical axis with the focus
setting to infinity. So, factors like chromatic

183
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,930
aberrations, off-axis performance in the image
field and the at proximity are not included

184
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,760
in this test. I've actually made a video on
how to quantitatively measure all these aspects

185
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,089
using another method and obtain a more holistic
performance. But even with all the limitations,

186
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:48,029
I think it is worthwhile to take a look at
the wavefront error that this lens introduces.

187
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,089
So here is the wavefront error of the lens
at its full aperture and as you can see, it’s

188
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,800
is actually pretty large. The total P-V wavefront
error is more than 3 lambda and the most apparent

189
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,699
errors are spherical aberration and some astigmatisms.
The Strehl ratio is quite disappointing as

190
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,099
well. As a consequence, this lens can never
provide high sharpness images at the maximum

191
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,309
aperture. Now, it’s interesting to see what
happens if we limit the aperture of this lens

192
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,880
to let’s say to F/4.0. By doing that, we
will lose a lot of light, about 90%. But this

193
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,001
also limits the wavefront error to the one
present in this central part here. So, if

194
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:32,910
we do the same wavefront analysis at F/4,
suddenly the lens performs diffraction limited.

195
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,940
Because reducing aperture to F/4 eliminates
almost all of the spherical error and the

196
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,140
astigmatism which is present in the wavefront
at full aperture.

197
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:51,410
Here is a comparison of the text on a permanent
marker shot with F/1.2 and F/4 on an aps-c

198
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:57,250
sensor. It’s clear that the 3-lambda wavefront
error is influencing the sharpness and contrast

199
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,210
pretty badly. So, I guess the only way to
use this lens effectively is to always set

200
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,850
it to a smaller aperture whenever there is
sufficient light available, otherwise you’ll

201
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:15,880
end up with very soft images.
The Canon EF 24 to 105mm full frame zoom lens

202
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,789
is next on our list. I just want to take a
very brief look at it, mainly because I sometimes

203
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:26,320
use it for my YouTube videos. With its maximum
aperture of F/4 over the whole zoom range

204
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,220
it is not particularly photon hungry. But
it always produces excellent image sharpness,

205
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,820
which made me curious about how small the
wavefront errors in a high-quality lens are.

206
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,640
It was measured in the same way as the F/1.2
lens, so in autocollimation. And here are

207
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,220
the wavefront errors at focal length settings
of 24mm, 50mm and 105mm. The largest wavefront

208
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,390
errors are found at 105mm focal distance,
where the Strehl ratio has dropped to 0.6.

209
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,600
Which by the way is still a very decent value.
In the center of the range, its performance

210
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,960
is basically diffraction limited. So concluding:
this lens performs well in the full zoom range.

211
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,260
That is of course, within all the limitations
of the current testing method.

212
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,590
If you made it this far into the video you
are probably more than averagely interested

213
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:28,160
in optics. So, for this last part I thought
I’d present measurements that I did on microscope

214
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,710
objectives. All objectives presented here
are all so called “infinity corrected”

215
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,050
objectives. This means that they are designed
to work in combination with a so-called tube

216
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,390
lens rather than create an image directly
like is the case with a proximity-corrected

217
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:49,620
objectives. Since infinity corrected objectives
basically project their image at infinity,

218
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,370
this allows us to correctly use the autocollimation
configuration for testing.

219
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:01,210
Unlike camera lenses, microscope objectives
aren't specified by focal length and maximum

220
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,799
focal distance to aperture ratio. Instead,
they are characterized by magnification and

221
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,700
numerical aperture. I’ll very briefly discuss
these two aspects first.

222
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,350
Magnification describes the ratio between
the object size and image size that a particular

223
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,990
microscope objective is designed for. You
can of course try to use it at a different

224
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,240
magnification by changing both the lens-object
distance and the lens-image distance. But

225
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,180
if you do that, it will not perform optimally.
And this is important because microscope optics

226
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,180
is required to work close to the theoretical
best performance. So in this sense, a microscope

227
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,919
objective is a bit different from a camera
lens, which is basically designed to give

228
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,900
you acceptable image quality over a wide range
of object to lens distances.

229
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,030
Now, specifying a high magnification is only
useful if the sharpness in the image keeps

230
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,830
up with the magnification that is specified.
And that is why the Magnification and Numerical

231
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:05,630
Aperture of objectives are related, because
Numerical Aperture is a key parameter for

232
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:13,049
resolving small features.
By definition, the NA is equal to the refractive

233
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,919
index of the medium that contains the object,
times the SIN() of the maximum angle theta

234
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,110
at which light originating from the object
can be captured. This means that NA increases

235
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,971
with the refractive index of the medium and
with the value of theta. Now, since all the

236
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:36,051
objectives I will discuss today are intended
for use in air and not in water- or oil, we

237
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:42,049
can simplify things because the refractive
index of air is 1. So for now we can just

238
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:47,880
ignore the refractive index which means that
NA in all cases discussed here is just equal

239
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,679
to the sin() of theta.
The exact reason why NA is the key parameter

240
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,980
for achieving a high sharpness is quite fascinating.
But it is kind of a rabbit hole, which I don’t

241
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,080
want to dive into now. Today I will just show
you the formula. So, the size of the smallest

242
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,390
features that can theoretically be resolved
by a microscope objective are proportional

243
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:15,730
to a constant, times the wavelength of light,
divided by the numerical aperture. This means

244
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,679
that it is possible to resolve smaller features
by either using a shorter wavelength of light,

245
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,940
or use a higher NA.
This relationship explains why magnification

246
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,900
and numerical aperture are so closely related
in the specification of microscope objectives.

247
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,929
Because attempting to pair a high magnification
with a low numerical aperture is pretty useless:

248
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,800
it will just result in a magnified image of
poor sharpness.

249
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:50,029
Let’s have a look at the measurements on
this Nikon 10x objective with a N.A. of 0.3.

250
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:54,850
Here is an image of the wavefront error of
this objective and it shows us that the errors

251
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:00,700
are in fact very small. The wavefront is accurate
within seven hundredths of a wavelength for

252
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,990
the entire aperture, the Strehl is 0.99, so
this is looking great. The major contribution

253
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,770
in the surface error is actually a very slight
spherical aberration, but all in all, this

254
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:17,700
is really a top-quality piece.
Now, let's examine a different objective,

255
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:26,000
like this 20x Leica Fluotar with a NA of 0.5,
and do the same wavefront measurement. Interestingly,

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,090
the spherical aberration in this objective
is noticably more pronounced. Both the total

257
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,600
peak-valley error as well as the Strehl ratio
is only just on the good side of the diffraction

258
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,080
limit. Now, it might be tempting to conclude
that this objective is not as good as the

259
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,770
previous one, but that's not the case. The
reason behind the spherical aberration is

260
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,480
in this particular number that can be found
on the objective. The number represents the

261
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,620
optimum cover slip thickness in millimeters
for this objective.

262
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,659
So, what the manufacturer assumes is that
you are going to use a glass cover slip when

263
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:06,909
you use your microscope and it therefore it
has already compensated the optical properties

264
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:14,590
for a specific glass thickness. Now, you might:
think huh 0.17mm of glass thickness, how is

265
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,990
that ever going to influence the focus? And
indeed, with low numerical aperture optics

266
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:26,419
there will generally not be a problem. However,
with increasing NA, even a glass plate this

267
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,480
thin can introduce a significant spherical
aberration. This is illustrated in this ray

268
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:39,770
tracing figure for a 0.7 NA. In a perfect
optic, all rays will end in a single point.

269
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:45,669
But add a cover glass and suddenly the area
where the rays end up has significant size.

270
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:51,309
Now of course the previous wavefront measurement
was done without a cover slip. So, the question

271
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:56,549
is what happens if we add a cover slip in
the light path? I quickly tried this with

272
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:03,620
a glass thickness of 0.16mm, so close to the
optimum value and it resulted in this measurement:

273
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,470
it reduced the spherical aberration quite
a bit. And so, this is something to realize

274
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,830
when you use a high-NA objectives: that it
can only perform at its peak performance when

275
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,760
used in combination with the cover slip thickness
specified.

276
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,640
So a few years ago, I bought this unmarked
NIKON 20x Plan APO OEM objective for use in

277
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,960
my maskless wafer stepper. These Nikon objectives
can be purchased on eBay for around 100 dollars

278
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,120
apiece and are widely available. It was in
perfect shape when it got here but when I

279
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,971
started using it, something was a bit off,
dependent on how I used it exactly. Now, when

280
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:50,870
I published the video on the maskless wafer
stepper, people at a forum called photomicrography.net

281
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,730
made me aware of the fact that these particular
types of objectives aren't optically the same

282
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,380
as the corresponding standard Nikon microscope
objectives; they are actually modified versions

283
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,440
that are designed for a different cover slip
thickness. The forum thread on this subject

284
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,460
mentioned that these perform better when used
in combination with 2 or 3 cover slips. And

285
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,919
since I now have an interferometer available
let’s see if we can narrow this value down

286
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,080
a bit further.
Here is the spherical aberration of the objective

287
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,649
without a cover slip. The wavefront error
is 1 lambda, so without a correction, it will

288
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:32,149
certainly perform very poorly. Here I summarized
the individual wavefront measurements for

289
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:42,610
0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 cover slips. I think the
effect of adding more glass is pretty clear.

290
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,779
You can see that the wavefront error sort
of flips over between 2 and 3 cover slips

291
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,690
of glass thickness.
What we can do now is take for example the

292
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,100
peak to valley spherical aberration from these
measurements and plot the values as a function

293
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,909
of the total glass thickness in a graph. And
by fitting a line through these data, we find

294
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:10,330
that a minimum aberration is at around 0.42-0.43mm.
And this thickness is right between 2 and

295
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,070
3 cover slips, like it was stated on the forum.
Here is a similar graph that I made for the

296
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:22,020
maximum Strehl ratio, which yields exactly
the same outcome. So, if we were to add a

297
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,270
0.42 mm glass sheet when using it, we can
effectively get rid of the huge spherical

298
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,980
aberration completely and use this objective
at its maximum performance level again.

299
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,590
Okay, we’ve finally come to the end of the
video. I hope I gave you some ideas of how

300
00:27:38,590 --> 00:28:06,960
interferometry can be used for optical testing.
Thanks for watching.
