# Random Ball Method

The random ball method is a cost-effective approach for calibrating the reference transmission sphere in an interferometer. This method involves using a small, smooth ball with a reflective surface to measure the surface shape at many random positions and then averaging these measurements.

## Why Use the Random Ball Method?

<Callout type="info">
The random ball method is an excellent alternative to using expensive, high-accuracy reference surfaces for calibrating transmission spheres. By averaging the measurements from multiple random positions on a ball surface, the errors in individual parts of the surface will eventually average out, iterating to the surface equivalent of a perfect sphere.
</Callout>

The only remaining error after averaging a sufficient number of measurements is the surface error in the reference sphere itself, as it is systematically present in all individual measurements.

## Materials Needed

To perform the random ball method, you will need:

- A small, smooth ball with a reflective surface (e.g., a precision aluminum oxide bearing ball)
- A stand to hold the ball in place during measurements

<Callout type="info">
Precision aluminum oxide bearing balls are an affordable alternative to expensive, high-accuracy SiC balls. The largest bearing balls, typically around 10mm in diameter, have a variation in diameter of about 1 micron, which is sufficient for this calibration method.

## Calibration Procedure

<Steps>

### Step 1: Set up the calibration stand

Create a stand to hold the ball in place during measurements. One option is to use three quarter-inch bearing balls glued on top of an aluminum rod using epoxy.

### Step 2: Place the ball at the center of curvature

Position the ball at the center of the radius of curvature of the transmission sphere in a random orientation.

### Step 3: Record interferograms

Record an interferogram, then choose a different (random) area on the ball, record another interferogram, and repeat this process for multiple positions on the ball surface.

### Step 4: Evaluate the results

Use interferogram analysis software, such as [DFTfringe](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/interferogram-analysis-dftfringe), to evaluate the surface error in each individual measurement.

### Step 5: Average the measurements

Average the surface error measurements from all the interferograms. As more measurements are added to the average, the surface error will gradually decrease.

### Step 6: Determine the reference sphere accuracy

Continue adding measurements to the average until no further improvement in the result is observed. At this point, the remaining error represents the accuracy of the transmission sphere reference.

## Example Results

Here's an example of how the surface error decreases as more measurements are averaged:

- After 10 measurements: Error drops to 1/10th of a lambda (peak-to-valley)
- After 50 measurements: Error stabilizes at around 1/20th of a lambda (peak-to-valley)

In this example, the wavefront accuracy of the transmission sphere over its full area is determined to be approximately 1/20th of a lambda. However, when using only a small fraction of the reference surface during actual measurements, the accuracy will be even higher.

By following the random ball method, you can effectively calibrate your transmission sphere reference without the need for expensive, high-accuracy reference surfaces.
