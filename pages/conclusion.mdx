# Conclusion

In this two-part video series, we explored the principles of optical interferometry and demonstrated how to use a ZYGO GPI LC interferometer to measure various optical components. We started by [introducing the basics of interferometry](/introduction) and the [layout of the ZYGO interferometer](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer).

We then showed how to [upgrade the interferometer with a modern camera](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/upgrading-with-modern-camera) for high-resolution interferogram analysis using [DFTfringe software](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/interferogram-analysis-dftfringe). This allowed us to create detailed wavefront maps and quantify the performance of optical components.

Before measuring any optics, we [calibrated the reference transmission sphere](/calibrating-transmission-sphere) using the [random ball method](/calibrating-transmission-sphere/random-ball-method). This cost-effective approach ensured accurate measurements in the subsequent tests.

We then demonstrated how to measure a variety of optical components, including:
- [Spherical mirror](/measuring-optical-components/spherical-mirror)
- [Canon FD 55mm F/1.2 lens](/measuring-optical-components/canon-fd-55mm-lens) 
- [Canon EF 24-105mm zoom lens](/measuring-optical-components/canon-ef-24-105mm-lens)
- [Microscope objectives](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives)

For the microscope objectives, we explained the relationship between [magnification and numerical aperture](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives/magnification-numerical-aperture) and the impact of [cover slip thickness](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives/cover-slip-thickness) on high-NA objectives. We also determined the optimal cover slip thickness for a [modified Nikon 20x Plan APO OEM objective](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives/nikon-20x-plan-apo-oem).
