# Introduction

Optical interferometry is a powerful technique for measuring the properties of optical components and systems with nanometer-scale precision. It works by analyzing interference patterns created by the superposition of two or more wavefronts. This method is widely used in optics manufacturing, quality control, and research to characterize the shape, surface roughness, and wavefront distortions of lenses, mirrors, and other optical elements.

In this two-part video series, we will explore the principles behind optical interferometry and demonstrate how to use a ZYGO GPI LC interferometer to measure various optical components. The ZYGO GPI LC is a high-quality interferometer produced in the 1990s, capable of measuring flat and spherical surfaces with sub-wavelength accuracy.

## Key Concepts

To understand optical interferometry, it is essential to grasp the following concepts:

- **Wavefront**: A surface of constant phase in an electromagnetic wave. In optics, wavefronts are perpendicular to the direction of light propagation.
- **Coherence**: The ability of two or more waves to maintain a fixed phase relationship over time and space. Coherent light sources, such as lasers, are essential for interferometry.
- **Interference**: The superposition of two or more waves, resulting in a new wave pattern. Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, while destructive interference occurs when they are out of phase.

## Measuring with Interferometry

Interferometry measures the shape of a wavefront by comparing it to a reference wavefront of known shape. The process involves the following steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Generate a reference wavefront
Use a high-quality optical surface, such as a transmission sphere or a flat reference, to create a known wavefront shape.

### Step 2: Combine the reference and test wavefronts
Reflect the reference wavefront off the surface under test, and recombine it with the original reference wavefront using a beam splitter.

### Step 3: Analyze the interference pattern
Observe the resulting interference pattern, which contains information about the difference in shape between the reference and test wavefronts. The pattern consists of alternating light and dark fringes, with each fringe representing a constant phase difference between the wavefronts.

### Step 4: Calculate the wavefront error
Use software to process the interferogram and calculate the wavefront error, which represents the deviation of the test surface from the ideal shape. The wavefront error is typically expressed in units of wavelength or nanometers.

In the following sections, we will take a closer look at the [ZYGO GPI LC interferometer](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer) and demonstrate how to use it to measure the quality of various optical components, such as [spherical mirrors](/measuring-optical-components/spherical-mirror), [camera lenses](/measuring-optical-components/canon-fd-55mm-lens), and [microscope objectives](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives).

Optical interferometry is a non-contact, non-destructive technique that provides highly accurate measurements of optical surfaces and wavefronts. It is an essential tool for anyone involved in the design, fabrication, or testing of precision optics.
