# Measuring Optical Components

In this section, we will demonstrate the use of the ZYGO GPI LC interferometer to measure various optical components. The interferometer, equipped with a high-resolution camera and powerful analysis software, allows us to accurately evaluate the wavefront error and surface accuracy of different optical elements.

We will examine the following components:

- [Spherical Mirror](/measuring-optical-components/spherical-mirror): A high-quality concave wafer scanner mirror from the 1970s.
- [Canon FD 55mm F/1.2 Lens](/measuring-optical-components/canon-fd-55mm-lens): A vintage lens known for its fast aperture and aspherical element.
- [Canon EF 24-105mm Zoom Lens](/measuring-optical-components/canon-ef-24-105mm-lens): A modern full-frame zoom lens commonly used in photography and videography.
- [Microscope Objectives](/measuring-optical-components/microscope-objectives): Various infinity-corrected objectives with different magnifications and numerical apertures.

  It is important to note that wavefront measurements alone do not provide a complete picture of an optical component's performance. Factors such as chromatic aberrations, off-axis performance, and performance at different object distances should also be considered for a comprehensive evaluation.

To measure these components, we will use the following general steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1

Set up the interferometer in the appropriate configuration (e.g., autocollimation for lenses and objectives).

### Step 2

Align the optical component under test to obtain a clear interferogram with well-defined fringes.

### Step 3

Capture multiple interferograms with slightly different fringe angles and spacings.

### Step 4

Analyze the interferograms using DFTfringe software to generate detailed wavefront maps and quantify the wavefront error.

By following these steps, we can gain valuable insights into the performance and limitations of each optical component. The subsequent subsections will delve into the specific measurements and analyses for each component.
