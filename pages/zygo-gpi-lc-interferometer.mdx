## Key Components

The ZYGO GPI LC interferometer consists of the following key components:

- Helium-Neon laser with a high-voltage power supply
- Optical components (steering mirror, variable filter, beam splitters)
- Two low-resolution PCB cameras (one for alignment, one for interferogram display)
- Collimation lens (4-inch diameter)
- Mains 12V DC power supply
- Adjustment mechanism for mounting reference surfaces

The high-quality components used in the ZYGO interferometer contribute to its exceptional performance and accuracy.

## Functionality

The ZYGO GPI LC interferometer works by splitting a laser beam into two paths: a reference path and a test path. The reference path reflects off a known reference surface, while the test path reflects off the surface under test. The two beams are then recombined, creating an interference pattern that contains information about the difference in shape between the reference and test surfaces.

The interferometer can be used to measure both flat and spherical surfaces, as well as complete optical systems. It achieves this by using various reference surfaces, such as transmission spheres, which are designed to reflect light back into the interferometer with minimal aberrations.

## Upgrades and Analysis

To further enhance the capabilities of the ZYGO GPI LC interferometer, two key upgrades and analysis techniques are discussed in the following subsections:

- [Upgrading with a Modern Camera](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/upgrading-with-modern-camera): Replacing the original low-resolution camera with a high-resolution IP camera for detailed interferogram analysis.
- [Interferogram Analysis with DFTfringe](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/interferogram-analysis-dftfringe): Using DFTfringe software to create detailed wavefront maps from interferograms.

These upgrades and analysis techniques allow for more precise measurements and detailed evaluations of optical components and systems.
