# Upgrading with a Modern Camera

The original ZYGO GPI LC interferometer was equipped with two low-resolution cameras, one for alignment and one for displaying the interferogram. Both cameras had a limited resolution of 320x240 pixels, which is not ideal for detailed interferogram analysis. To improve the interferometer's capabilities, we replaced the original camera with a modern IP camera.

## Selecting the Camera

When choosing a new camera for the interferometer, we considered the following factors:

- **Housing and mounting options**: The camera should have a housing that allows for easy attachment of various lenses.
- **Space constraints**: The interferometer has limited space inside, so the camera should be compact enough to fit.
- **Resolution**: The camera should have a higher resolution than the original 320x240 pixels to capture more detail in the interferograms.

After evaluating different options, we settled on an IDS Ethernet camera with a compact 25mm C-mount lens. This combination allows us to capture the full field of the interferometer while covering a large area of the camera sensor.

Although we used an IDS Ethernet camera for this upgrade, any camera that can be accessed from a computer and store images to disk will work.

## Installation Process

<Steps>

### Step 1: Remove the old camera

Remove the old camera and lens from the interferometer. In the ZYGO GPI LC, there is ample space to place a new camera [here](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer).

### Step 2: Install the mirror bracket

Make a bracket to hold a first surface mirror at a 45-degree angle. This mirror will redirect the vertical beam from the interferometer to a horizontal one, which the new camera can capture.

### Step 3: Mount the camera and lens

Mount the new camera and lens on the bracket, ensuring that the camera is positioned to capture the redirected beam from the mirror.

### Step 4: Connect power and data

Connect the camera to the 12V power supply already present in the interferometer. Bring the camera's UTP connection to the housing of the interferometer using a two-sided UTP female connector. One side connects to the camera, and the other side connects to the PC.

With the new camera installed, you can now capture high-resolution interferograms for detailed analysis using software like [DFTfringe](/zygo-gpi-lc-interferometer/interferogram-analysis-dftfringe).

The original alignment camera was left in place, as it still works well for alignment purposes and does not require high resolution.

By upgrading the ZYGO GPI LC interferometer with a modern camera, you can significantly improve its capabilities and perform more advanced interferogram analysis, making it a valuable tool for optical testing and metrology.
